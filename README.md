- Node.js installed
- MongoDB account and database
- SMTP server credentials for email services

3. Set up your environment variables in a .env file based on the provided examples in the backend.
   
4. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install

## Usage
